---- Challenge 1 ----


The randow variable is: Any outcome from the measureable space, in this case a combination of two numbers.

*** A. The values that the player obtains.

There are 21 outcomes.

The measurable space is:
(1,1) (2,2) (3,3) (4,4) (5,5) (6,6)
(1,2) (2,3) (3,4) (4,5) (5,6) 
(1,3) (2,4) (3,5) (4,6)
(1,4) (2,5) (3,6)
(1,5) (2,6)
(1,6)

*** B. The sum of the values obtained.

11 potential outcome as one cannot be a sum.

*** C.
The maximum value obtained after rolling both dices: 
{1,2,3,4,5,6}

*** Case A: Both values are greater than 5. 

The measureable space is :
(6,6)

There are 1 possible outcome.

*** Case B: The sum of values is even.

Out of the 11 outcomes, 6 possible outcomes.

*** Case C: The maximum is the value of both rolls.
There is one possibility to achive getting the max: (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) (4,4) (5,5) (6,6)


---- Challenge 2 ----


One player picks two cards from a poker deck. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:

The randow variable is: Any outcome from the measureable space, in this case a combination of a number and shape.

*** A. The number of figures he picks. 

He can pick either one figure or two figures by picking two cards.
There is 12x12 combinations:
144 possibilities

There is two different way:

He first picked a figure card.
The measureable space is 12 then 11.

He did not picked a figure card at the first time but at the second time.
The measureable space is 12 then again 12.

*** B. The sum of card values. Consider that the value of figures is 10 and the value of aces is 15.

The sum of the card value is 12*10 + 15*15 = 345

*** C. The number of hearts or spades he picks.

He first picked a heart or spade.
The measureable space is 26 then 25.

He did not picked a heart or spade at the first time but at the second time.
The measureable space is 26 then again 26.

Describe the following events:
*** Case A: The number of figures in the cards the player picked is two. 
He first picked a figure card.
The measureable space is 12 then 11.

First, he could pick 1 card out of the 12 faced cards, and then a second card out of the 11 remaining faced cards.

2. and how many option are there for that.
12*11 = 132.

*** Case B: The sum of card values is 17.
The measureable space is 4, taking into consideration that the order does not matter (e.g. 10,7 = 7,10). Otherwise, it is 4.

(10,7)
(9,6)
(8,7)
(7,7)


*** Case C: The value of both cards is less than 8.
The measureable space is 16 , taking into consideration that the order does not matter (e.g. 10,7 = 7,10). Otherwise, it is 32.


(1,1) (2,2) (3,3) (4,4)
(1,2) (2,3) (3,4) 
(1,3) (2,4) (3,5) 
(1,4) (2,5) 
(1,5) (2,6)
(1,6)
(1,7)

---- CHALLENGE 3 ----

Two players roll a dice. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:

The randow variable is: Any outcome from the measureable space, in this case a combination of two numbers

*** A. The score of player A.

The measurable space is:
(1,1) (2,2) (3,3) (4,4) (5,5) (6,6)
(1,2) (2,3) (3,4) (4,5) (5,6) 
(1,3) (2,4) (3,5) (4,6)
(1,4) (2,5) (3,6)
(1,5) (2,6)
(1,6)

*** B. The greatest score.

The measurable space is:
(1,2) (2,3) (3,4) (4,5) (5,6) 
(1,3) (2,4) (3,5) (4,6)
(1,4) (2,5) (3,6)
(1,5) (2,6)
(1,6)

*** C. The earnings of player A if the game rules state that:  

"The player with the greatest score gets a coin from the other player.".

Either player 1 gets a coin and player 2 does not get a coin.
Either player 2 gets a coin and player 1 does not get a coin.
Either player the result is even and nobody gets a coin.


* D. The earnings of player A if the game rules state that:  

"The player with the greatest score gets as many coins as the difference between the score of player A and player B.". 
The measureable space is 1,2,3,4,5,6


Describe the following events:
* Case A: The score of player A is 2.
The measureable space is:
(2,3) 
(2,4)
(2,5)
(2,6)

* Case B: The greatest score is lower or equal than 2.
The measureable space is:
(1,1)
(2,1)
(1,2)

* Case C: Considering the case where the winner gets as many coins as the difference between scores (D), describe: 

  * Player A wins at least 4 coins.
The measureable space is:
(5,1) (6,2)
(6,1)

  
  * Player A loses more than 2 coins.
The measureable space is:
(1,3) (2,4) (3,5) (4,6)
(1,4) (2,5) (3,6)
(1,5) (2,6)
(1,6)
  
  
  * Player A neither wins nor loses coins.
The measureable space is:
(1,1) (2,2) (3,3) (4,4) (5,5) (6,6)
