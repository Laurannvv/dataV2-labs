7. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 5. Give some insights.

I had a look at the categories as I find the link between this data and the most rated app is relevant, here are my findings:

	- Facebook is the most rated social networking app.
	- Instagram is the most rated photo &amp; video app.
	- Clash of clans is the most rated game app.
	- Music is the most rated photo &amp; video app.

8. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 6. Give some insights.

:) Sudoku + is the best rated app.

I've also looked at the number of users' votes  as I find the link between this data and the best rated app is relevant, here are my findings:

	- Learn to Speak Spanish Fast With MosaLingua only has 9 votes.

	- Plants vs. Zombies has the most votes within the best rated apps.

 	- The genres are more diverse in the most rated apps.

11. Do people care about the price of an app? Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?

The parameters I find relevant to assess whether people cares about the price of the apps are:
	- the rating_count_tot which involves that an app was dowload many times and that people actually took the time to rate it;
	- the user_rating meaning that people actually liked the apps.
	
We see that the 10 most rated apps' prices are under 10€, and that these most rated apps' prices are under the mean of the prices' categories (36.934722222222234).

Additionally, we see that the 10 best rated apps' prices are under 10€, and that these best rated apps' prices app are under the mean of the prices' categories (36.934722222222234).

I would conclude that people cares about the price, knowing that the prices of the best rated and the most rated apps are under 10€ which could qualify as being affordable and, particularily, that these prices are under the  mean of the prices' categories (36.934722222222234). */
